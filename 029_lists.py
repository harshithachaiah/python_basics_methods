# When looking at strings, I mentioned the concept of data
# structures.

# To remind you, a data structure is a collection of data
# organised in a certain way. A string is a sequence of
# characters.

# We're now going to look at another kind â€” the list. A list
# is a sequence of items, and those items can be of any
# type.

# Here's are two examples:

my_favourite_numbers = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
my_friends = ["Victoria", "Mel", "Melanie", "Emma"]

# Notice how the square brackets tell Python that this is
# a list, and the commas separate the items in the list.

# @TASK Try making your own here:

your_list = ...
print(your_list)

# @TASK and print it out by running:

# python 029_lists.py

# When you're done, move on to 030_list_indexing.py
