# The Perfect Crab Introduction to Programming

Welcome!

This is a series of exercises designed to help you learn the
fundamentals of programming necessary to succeed in the
Makers coding assessment. We'll be using Python, but the
ideas will apply to any language.

## How do I get started?

Click the 'Fork' button to the right. This will open up the
programming interface you will use to learn.

If you're confident using your own local development setup
and you have Python 3 installed, you can clone this
repository and work through it that way. 

## How do I use the replit interface?

The interface is made by an organisation called replit. We
will call it the replit IDE.

You will need to engage with three parts of it:

* The file panel on your left, working top to bottom.
* The code panel (that's this one) where you'll read and
  write code.
* The shell panel to the right, where you'll run code.

To set up and learn how to use the interface, please follow
the [replit IDE setup video](#link-to-video). This video has
subtitles.

You may find the default replit theme hard to read. We have
created two themes which combine good contrast and
readability. I would recommend you use one of them:

* [Makers Reader Theme (Light)](https://replit.com/theme/@neoeno/makers-reader)
* [Makers Reader Theme (Dark)](https://replit.com/theme/@neoeno/makers-reader-dark)

## How to read the material

The learning materials are code. They look a bit like this:

```python
def identity(num):
    return num

# This is a function. A function is a reusable block of code.
```

The first two lines are code. This is what you will be
learning how to create.

That last line starting with a `#` is a comment. We will
talk you through the ideas behind the code using comments.

You should read through each file top to bottom.

## What if I would prefer to watch than to read?

There are video alternatives for each file that you can
follow along with. You can find them as a link at the top of
each file.

## I have some feedback about the material
